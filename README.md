# About

"Order Fruit" is an Android application that is made for practice for SqliteDB, and RazorPay Integration. I used a local database for practice and made features like an e-commerce app. I also used SQL-Joins on the tables. Apart from imageLoading and Razorpay-test-Payment, our app doesn't require an internet connection.
